Description: A statistical framework and analysis tool for open chromatin 
  analysis designed specifically for single cell ATAC-seq (Assay for 
  Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) data, after cell type/cluster 
  identification. These novel modules remove unwanted technical variation, 
  identify open chromatin, robustly models repeated measures in single cell 
  data, implement advanced statistical frameworks to model zero-inflation for 
  differential and co-accessibility analyses, and integrate with existing 
  databases and modules for downstream analyses to reveal biological insights. 
  MOCHA provides a statistical foundation for complex downstream analysis to 
  help advance the potential of single cell ATAC-seq for applied studies. 
  Methods for zero-inflated statistics are as described in:
