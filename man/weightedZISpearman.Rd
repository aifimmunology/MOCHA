\description{
scHOT implemented Pimentel's zero-inflated (ZI) correlation
in their R package, providing implementations 
of the ZI spearman and tau rank correlations. 
scMACS implements a slight modification of 
scHOT's zero-inflated correlation measure, by
returning NAs in the cases where the correlation
is undefined, and modifying it to use a C-backed correlation program. 
Both references are provided below and are
referenced in all documentations to indicate
their work in implementing these methods.

\details{
Description: 
the weightedZISpearman function calculates weighted rho\*,
where rho\* is described in Pimentel et al (2009).
This association measure is defined for zero-inflated,
non-negative random variables.
