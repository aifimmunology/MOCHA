\title{Run Linear Mixed-Effects Modeling for continuous,
 non-zero inflated data}
\usage{
runLMEM(
  ExperimentObj,
  assayName = NULL,
  modelFormula = NULL,
  initialSampling = 5,
  verbose = FALSE,
  numCores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ExperimentObj}{A SummarizedExperiment object generated from
getSampleTileMatrix, chromVAR, or other. It is expected to contain only
one assay, or only the first assay will be used for the model.
Data should not be zero-inflated.}

\item{assayName}{The name of the assay to model within the SummarizedExperiment.}

\item{modelFormula}{The formula to use with lmerTest::lmer, in the
format (exp ~ factors). All factors must be found in column names
of the ExperimentObj metadata. modelFormula must start with 'exp' as the response.
See \link[lmerTest]{lmer}.}

\item{initialSampling}{Size of data to use for pilot}

\item{verbose}{Set TRUE to display additional messages. Default is FALSE.}

\item{numCores}{integer. Number of cores to parallelize across.}
}
\value{
results a SummarizedExperiment containing LMEM results. Assays are metrics related to the model coefficients,
         including the Estimate, Std_Error, df, t_value, p_value. Within each assay, each row corresponds to each row of
         the SummarizedExperiment and columns correspond to each fixed effect variable within the model.
         Any row metadata from the ExperimentObject (see rowData(ExperimentObj)) is preserved in the output.
         The Residual matrix and the variance of the random effects are saved in the metadata slot of the output.
