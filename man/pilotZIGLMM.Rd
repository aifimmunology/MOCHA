\usage{
pilotZIGLMM(
  TSAM_Object,
  cellPopulation = NULL,
  continuousFormula = NULL,
  ziformula = NULL,
  zi_threshold = 0,
  verbose = FALSE,
  pilotIndices = 1:10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{TSAM_Object}{A SummarizedExperiment object generated from
getSampleTileMatrix, chromVAR, or other.}

\item{cellPopulation}{A single cell population on which to run this pilot
model}

\item{continuousFormula}{The formula, see \code{\link[glmmTMB]{glmmTMB}}.
Combined fixed and random effects formula, following lme4 syntax.}

\item{ziformula}{The zero-inflated formula, see
\code{\link[glmmTMB]{glmmTMB}}. a one-sided (i.e., no response variable)
formula for zero-inflation combining fixed and random effects: the default
~0 specifies no zero-inflation. Specifying ~. sets the zero-inflation
formula identical to the right-hand side of formula (i.e., the conditional
effects formula); terms can also be added or subtracted. When using ~. as
the zero-inflation formula in models where the conditional effects formula
contains an offset term, the offset term will automatically be dropped. The
zero-inflation model uses a logit link.}

\item{zi_threshold}{Zero-inflated threshold (range = 0-1), representing the
fraction of samples with zeros. When the percentage of zeros in the tile is
between 0 and zi_threshold, samples with zeroes are dropped and only the
continous formula is used. Use this parameter at your own risk. Default is
0.}

\item{verbose}{Set TRUE to display additional messages. Default is FALSE.}

\item{pilotIndices}{A vector of integers defining the subset of the
ExperimentObj matrix. Default is 1:10.}
}
\value{
modelList a list of outputs from glmmTMB::glmmTMB
