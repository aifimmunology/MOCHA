  ATAC (29:44, 37:27)

Package has a FOSS license but eventually depends on the following
package which restricts use:
  CNEr

We use the GPL v3 License. CNEr on Bioconductor uses the GPL v2 license and
has dependencies with GPL v3 in Bioconductor.

‚ùØ checking package dependencies ... NOTE
  Imports includes 30 non-default packages.
  Importing from so many packages makes the package vulnerable to any of
  them becoming unavailable.  Move as many as possible to Suggests and
  use conditionally.

MOCHA is a comprehensive analysis package for the fundamental steps of downstream analysis with scATAC data - having many dependencies is not unexpected. Most dependencies are very popular or are found in Bioconductor, and are well maintained per Bioconductor guidelines. 

* This is a new release.
